Hero6Project
============

A web interface for reviewing aspects of the Hero6 project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/hero6/)

The original concept and design for this project was a learning exercise.  However, the open source nature of the Hero6 project lends itself to practical implementation through academic endeavors.

This web interface provides review and modifications of a mySQL database which can be built via the Hero6.sql file.  The design is intended to be hosted on a web server using mySQL and PHP.  It makes use of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, mySQL, PHP, mySQLi, and the jQuery library, ColorPicker.  It also contains an instance of jDOSbox loading a freeware demo of The Secret of Monkey Islandâ„¢, a PC adventure game.  

The login interface is purely academic and not intended to restrict modification access at this time.  It is more likely, that these capabilities will be merged with an existing login interface on the Hero6.org web server (i.e., phpBB or WordPress).  

The images directory contains a snapshot gallery of the Hero6 sprite and background images as of June, 2014.  

The js directory contains all supporting Javascript library files.

The Supporting Docs directory contains an outline for this project and the database schema and ER diagram.  The schema and ER diagram were created using PowerPoint to meet project guidelines; however, there is also a much cleaner and easier to read mySQL workbench file included.
